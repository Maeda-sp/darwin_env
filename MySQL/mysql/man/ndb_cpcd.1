.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBndb_cpcd \fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This utility is found in the
\fIlibexec\fR
directory. It is part of an internal automated test framework used in testing and bedugging MySQL Cluster. Because it can control processes on remote systems, it is not advisable to use
\fBndb_cpcd\fR
in a production cluster.
.PP
Because some users may be interested in employing the Cluster testing framework for their own development or testing purposes, we intend to make details of this application's usage available in the near future as part of the MySQL Internals Manual.
.PP
The source files for
\fBndb_cpcd\fR
may be found in the directory
\fIstorage/ndb/src/cw/cpcd\fR, in the MySQL 5.0 source tree.
