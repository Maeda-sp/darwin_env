\fBndb_error_reporter\fR

This utility is intended for use on a management node host, and requires the path to the management host configuration file (\fIconfig.ini\fR). Optionally, you can supply the name of a user that is able to access the cluster's data nodes via SSH, in order to copy the data node log files. ndb_error_reporter then includes all of these files in archive that is created in the same directory in which it is run. The archive is named
\fIndb_error_report_\fR\fI\fIYYYYMMDDHHMMSS\fR\fR\fI.tar.bz2\fR, where
\fIYYYYMMDDHHMMSS\fR
is a datetime string.
.PP
If the
\fB\-\-fs\fR
is used, then the data node filesystems are also copied to the management host and included in the archive that is produced by this script. As data node filesystems can be extremely large even after being compressed, we ask that you please do
\fInot\fR
send archives created using this option to MySQL AB unless you are specifically requested to do so.
