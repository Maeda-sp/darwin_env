.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql\fR
program loads the time zone tables in the
mysql
database. It is used on systems that have a
zoneinfo
database (the set of files describing time zones). Examples of such systems are Linux, FreeBSD, Sun Solaris, and Mac OS X. One likely location for these files is the
\fI/usr/share/zoneinfo\fR
directory. If your system does not have a zoneinfo database, you can use the downloadable package described in
Section\ 8.8, \(lqMySQL Server Time Zone Support\(rq.
.PP
\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql\fR
can be invoked several ways:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql \fR\fB\fItz_dir\fR\fR
shell> \fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql \fR\fB\fItz_file tz_name\fR\fR
shell> \fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql \-\-leap \fR\fB\fItz_file\fR\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
For the first invocation syntax, pass the zoneinfo directory pathname to
\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql\fR
and send the output into the
\fBmysql\fR
program. For example:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql \-u root mysql\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql\fR
reads your system's time zone files and generates SQL statements from them.
\fBmysql\fR
processes those statements to load the time zone tables.
.PP
The second syntax causes
\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql\fR
to load a single time zone file
\fItz_file\fR
that corresponds to a time zone name
\fItz_name\fR:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql \fR\fB\fItz_file\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fItz_name\fR\fR\fB | mysql \-u root mysql\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
If your time zone needs to account for leap seconds, invoke
\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql\fR
using the third syntax, which initializes the leap second information.
\fItz_file\fR
is the name of your time zone file:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql \-\-leap \fR\fB\fItz_file\fR\fR\fB | mysql \-u root mysql\fR
.fi
