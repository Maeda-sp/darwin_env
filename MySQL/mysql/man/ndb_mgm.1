.SH "NAME"
ndb_mgm \- the management client process
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 16
\fBndb_mgm \fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBndb_mgm\fR
management client process is actually not needed to run the cluster. Its value lies in providing a set of commands for checking the cluster's status, starting backups, and performing other administrative functions. The management client accesses the management server using a C API. Advanced users can also employ this API for programming dedicated management processes to perform tasks similar to those performed by
\fBndb_mgm\fR.
.PP
To start the management client, it is necessary to supply the hostname and port number of the management server:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBndb_mgm [\fR\fB\fIhost_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIport_num\fR\fR\fB]]\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
For example:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBndb_mgm ndb_mgmd.mysql.com 1186\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
The default hostname and port number are
localhost
and 1186, respectively.
