mysql_install_db \- MySQL data directory initialization script
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 27
\fBmysql_install_db [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
initializes the MySQL data directory and creates the system tables that it contains, if they do not exist. Because the MySQL server,
\fBmysqld\fR, needs to access the data directory when it runs later, you should either run
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
from the same account that will be used for running
\fBmysqld\fR
or run it as
root
and use the
\fB\-\-user\fR
option to indicate the username that
\fBmysqld\fR
will run as.
.PP
To invoke
\fBmysql_install_db\fR, use the following syntax:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_install_db [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
needs to invoke
\fBmysqld\fR
with the
\fB\-\-bootstrap\fR
and
\fB\-\-skip\-grant\-tables\fR
options (see
Section\ 4.14.2, \(lqTypical \fBconfigure\fR Options\(rq). If MySQL was configured with the
\fB\-\-disable\-grant\-options\fR
option,
\fB\-\-bootstrap\fR
and
\fB\-\-skip\-grant\-tables\fR
will be disabled. To handle this, set the
MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP
environment variable to the full pathname of a server that has all options enabled.
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
will use that server.
.PP
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
supports the following options:
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-basedir=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp
The path to the MySQL installation directory.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-force\fR
.sp
Causes
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
to run even if DNS does not work. In that case, grant table entries that normally use hostnames will use IP addresses.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-datadir=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR,
\fB\-\-ldata=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp
The path to the MySQL data directory.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-rpm\fR
.sp
For internal use. This option is used by RPM files during the MySQL installation process.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-skip\-name\-resolve\fR
.sp
Use IP addresses rather than hostnames when creating grant table entries. This option can be useful if your DNS does not work.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-srcdir=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp
For internal use. The directory under which
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
looks for support files such as the error message file and the file for populating the help tables. This option was added in MySQL 5.0.32.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-user=\fR\fB\fIuser_name\fR\fR
.sp
The login username to use for running
\fBmysqld\fR. Files and directories created by
\fBmysqld\fR
will be owned by this user. You must be
root
to use this option. By default,
\fBmysqld\fR
runs using your current login name and files and directories that it creates will be owned by you.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
.sp
Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-windows\fR
.sp
For internal use. This option is used for creating Windows distributions.
