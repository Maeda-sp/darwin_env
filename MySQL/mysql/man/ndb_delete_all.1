.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBndb_delete_all\fR
deletes all rows from the given
NDB
table. In some cases, this can be much faster than
DELETE
or even
TRUNCATE.
.PP
\fBUsage\fR:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
ndb_delete_all \-c \fIconnect_string\fR \fItbl_name\fR \-d \fIdb_name\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
This deletes all rows from the table named
\fItbl_name\fR
in the database named
\fIdb_name\fR. It is exactly equivalent to executing
TRUNCATE \fIdb_name\fR.\fItbl_name\fR
in MySQL.
.PP
\fBAdditional Options\fR:
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-transactional\fR,
\fB\-t\fR
.sp
Use of this option causes the delete operation to be performed as a single transaction.
.sp
\fBWarning\fR: With very large tables, this using this option may cause the number of operations available to the cluster to be exceeded.
